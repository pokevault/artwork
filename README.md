# PokéVault Artwork Repo

This repo is a central location where all Sugimori-Style Pokémon art for the PokéVault Project will be stored.

It also serves as the base location for the [wsrv.nl](https://wsrv.nl) CDN to cache each image.

## Cloning

I suggest using `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pokevault/artwork.git` to avoid downloading the whole Git history
